title: Mac Setup

Here is an up-to-date list of software I always install when setting up a new
mac (or wiping my current mac.)  I find that keeping my environment somewhat
reproducible and backed up, I can wipe my mac more often.  I find that wiping my
computer is like cleaning out your room by taking everything out and only
putting back in the things you really need.
