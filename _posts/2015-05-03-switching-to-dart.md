I gave a talk at the 2015 Dart Developer Summit about a topic I am very
passionate about: productivity.  Here's the video:

## Why JavaScript Fatigue is a real problem

In short, our team switched from a TypeScript codebase after experiencing
JavaScript fatigue** - exhaustion from validating and betting on a vast number
of tools and packages that constantly change.  Often, these tools *can* be
combined, but aren't designed to work together.  It's rare to see two teams
using the same set of tools.

## Why Dart is better

Using Dart shifted the focus away from tools and libraries and allowed us to
work on the right things.  This shift in focus made us more effective, and I
would argue this increase in effectiveness is simply more *fun* and
*challenging*. When a team member spends hours fighting a tooling issue (or a
language issue for that matter), not only is it a waste of time, it's hugely
frustrating.  Dart made us better by simply getting out of the way and allowing
us to write great code.
